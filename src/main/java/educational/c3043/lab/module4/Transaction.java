/*
Activity 1
----------
Write a program to display person in-charge, transaction type (D-Deposit, W-Withdrawal), transaction
number and balance when the user withdrawing or deposit the money from the specific account.

You must define transaction number and balance as a static instance variable and each of the variables
defaulted to 0 and 1000.00 respectively.

Create the main program and run the following transactions:
1st transaction as a withdrawal transaction. Pass the parameters to the object using the following
information; account number = 1002, account name = “Ali”, transaction as withdrawal (“W”) and the
withdrawal amount is RM400.00.

2nd transaction as a deposit transaction. Pass the parameters to the object using the following
information; account number = 1002, account name = “Ali”, transaction as deposit (“D”) and the deposit
amount is RM100.00.

3rd transaction as a withdrawal transaction. Pass the parameters to the object using the following
information; account number = 1002, account name = “Ali”, transaction as withdrawal (“W”) and the
withdrawal amount is RM600.00

What are the last transaction number and the current balance?
Go run the code yourself
